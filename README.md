# Help All
 
"Help All" is an opportunity for those who are willing  to help find a place where they can help more people at the same time, focused  in the biggest  charities  in Ireland Help All provides the simple tool where in one donation the users can help 10 institutions.#


## UX:
- Made for those who have the will to help fueled by the desire to increase aid, we provide a simple way to donate by credit card an amount that will be shared between  10 institutions. 

- Nowadays  people are always trying  to find the easiest  way to solve their problems or to get what they want, Help All is the bridge between practicality and porpuse, with simplicity we deliver the opportunity to help those who need help.

- The colours and and illustrations  were chosen with the purpose of bringing lightness  encouraging people to be part of this, helping people and also trusting the projectâ€™s  idea.

- To developer the first sketch of this project was used the wireframe "Balsamiq.cloud" where it still hosted ( https://balsamiq.cloud/suhbz5n/pour9lw ).
